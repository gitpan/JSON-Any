        o Extensive code from Chris 'Perigrin' Prather, to extend
          the API to include aliases for other JSON modules. It is
          now possible to use the API for any underlying JSON module
          transparently.
        o Added ->handler() to return the underlying JSON object.
        o new() changed to allow configuration args to be passed to the
          underlying JSON object. These values are not universal, and so
          are do not work across different JSON engines.
